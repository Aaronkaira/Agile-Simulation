# Sprint Metrics & Measurement Framework

## Purpose

This document defines the **Agile metrics used to measure delivery performance** across multiple Scrum teams. Metrics are used to promote transparency, identify risks early, and support continuous improvement — not to micro-manage teams.

---

## Core Metrics Tracked

### Sprint Velocity

* Measures completed story points per sprint
* Used to forecast delivery capacity
* Tracked per team and across teams

---

### Delivery Predictability

* Percentage of committed work completed within a sprint
* Highlights planning accuracy and backlog readiness

---

### Cycle Time

* Measures time from **In Progress → Done**
* Used to identify workflow bottlenecks

---

### Work-in-Progress (WIP)

* Number of active tickets at a given time
* Helps detect overload and context switching

---

### Defect Ratio

* Defects vs total completed work
* Used to monitor quality trends

---

### BAU vs Project Allocation

* Capacity split between BAU and Project work
* Ensures operational work does not erode delivery commitments

---

## Data Sources

* Jira dashboards
* Sprint reports
* Workflow transition timestamps

---

## Metric Ownership

* **Scrum Master:** Tracking, interpretation, and communication
* **Teams:** Data accuracy
* **Leadership:** Decision-making and prioritization

---

## Expected Outcomes

* Improved sprint commitment reliability
* Faster issue detection
* Data-driven delivery discussions
