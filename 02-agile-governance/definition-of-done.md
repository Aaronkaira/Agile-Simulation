# Definition of Done (DoD)

## Purpose

The Definition of Done (DoD) establishes a **shared understanding of quality and completeness** across all Scrum teams. It ensures work is truly complete, releasable, and aligned with governance and quality standards.

A ticket is only considered **Done** when all DoD criteria are met.

## DoD Criteria

A Jira ticket is **Done** when:

### 1. Acceptance Criteria Met

* All acceptance criteria are fully implemented
* Validation confirms expected behavior
* No outstanding functional gaps remain

---

* Code follows agreed standards
* Builds pass without errors
* No critical or high-severity issues remain open

### 3. Testing Completed

* Required testing completed (unit, integration, or functional)
* Defects addressed or formally deferred
* QA sign-off obtained where applicable

## Not Done Indicators

A ticket is **NOT DONE** if:

* Acceptance criteria are partially met
